<h1>My Experiences at CofC</h1>
<h3>and with the C.I.S. Program.</h3>
<p>
My experiences with C of C have been overall positive. There are good people at the school who are willing to help when needed and the enviornment is motivating, most of the time.
It has given me a chance to experience multiple points of view that don't always match with my own. It has also given me an expanded knowledge on topics I wasn't even aware myself

that I wanted to know about or know more about. The computer science department has been relatively welcoming and filled with motivated people. I'm not to far into the C.I.S. program,
but overall my experience so far as been while callenging, it's something I can see myself continuing with if outside of school life continues to be managable.
