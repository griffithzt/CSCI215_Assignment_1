The only way to learn a second language is through repeated, meaningful exposure to it with ample opportunities to interact with others in that language. This class will be conducted in Spanish, and you will be expected to speak only Spanish. There is no need to panic! Each one of you is capable of keeping up as long as you follow the syllabus carefully, study outside of class, and come to office hours or go to the CSL for extra help when necessary.
